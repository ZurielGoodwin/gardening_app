Gardening app to calculate days to harvest
This is a passion project that I will never truly be done working on.
Eventually I want to use this for square foot gardening, to calculate the amount of possible plants per square foot, and represent them and their location in the garden.


BACKLOG:
Calculate days left on planting.
flash messages on harvest days.
User-input garden dimensions with sq ft calculator, per sq ft gardening method.
Visual representation of garden, with row by rows represented.
Weather integration for watering cycle.
Irrigation methods.
Rudimentary icons of plants.
And many more.
