[REQUIRED] Project Description: A gardening app in which you enter what you planted, when you planted it, and days to maturation. 
Then it will tell you how many days left until harvest based on the date planted. 

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: i believe this will force me to use more javascript than I have. It will take more math in than I've used in any project thus far.

[REQUIRED] Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
- Functioning login & registration, posts for garden tips, will likely need advice on how to make the planting calendar function as desired.

[REQUIRED] Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***
- functioning app, complete with post of user plants (user garden) and their days-til-harvest, and community posts.  

[REQUIRED] Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
- I want this to do so much, but I'm trying to make it into a sizable bite for this. I want it to be for square foot gardening; certain plants requiring square footage.So, 
anything you enter as planting would have been accounted for in the dimensions of your garden and limit you from planting more. This would require getting the garden dimensions,
having an interactive map of the gardening bed. Also, having a private vs public post function, and plenty of flash message tips based on amount of soil needed, garden location,
usage of space, etc.
